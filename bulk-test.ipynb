Hollywood i Pilgrims Arrive (Movie Style) By ERSKINE JOHNSON Thanksgiving Hollywood version: We open the picture with Captain Bligh (Charles Laughton) on the quarterdeck of a ship edging toward a huge rock.

At this challenge, 200 Indian braves pop into sight, waving not tomahawks, but bright colored bits of pasteboards. \\\"We got 'em,\\\" they yell. \\\"Rose Bowl seats on 50-yard line.\\\" \\\"Who are you?\\\" Captain Bligh thunders. \\\"Scalpers,\\\" comes a chorus. This becomes a big production number. The Stanford Indians come charging into the scene and go into a war dance from the T formation. Forty-two chorus girls disguised as Plymouth Rock hens dance and the company sings \\\"God Bless America.\\\" 9)c afe 9e 9 In the next scene passengers of boat appear on deck and come jigging down the gangplank of the ship. .The Pilgrims have landed. Our next full shot is 364 days after the Pilgrims landed. Priscilla (Priscilla La,ne) and John Alden (Robert Taylor) are seated on Plymouth Rock. John is telling Priscilla that Miles Standish (Brian Donlevy) is nuts about her, and does she want to become Mrs. Standish. Priscilla says, \\\"I rate a starring part. I refuse to be a stand-inish. Why don't you speak for yourself, you big dope.\\\" John says, \\\"I will.\\\" He does. Then he says, \\\"Let's go home. It's getting cold out here.\\\" As they walk off arm in arm we see \\\"1620\\\" imprinted on the seat of Alden's trousers. In another scene Captain Bligh is swaggering and roaring in a taproom with Hedy Lamarr on one shoulder, Lana Turner on the other and a jug of ale in each hand. The bartender (Edward G. Robinson) says to Captain Bligh, \\\"Look, chum, yu know we landed here just a year ago tomorrow. And we've had good times ever since.\\\" Captain Bligh studies for a moment and bellows, \\\"That's an idea we'll have Thanksgiving tomorrow.\\\" He lurches out the door. Hedy asks where he's going. \\\"To get some turkeys,\\\" he says. Later a long dolly shot of the length of the banquet table. The guests start yelling speech, speech at Captain Bligh. He stands up and starts, \\\"My friends \\\" just then a newsboy with an extra runs into the forest clearing. The headline reads: '\\\"FDR AGAIN CHANGES THANKSGIVING DATE. Not today Next Thursday.\\\" Captain Bligh says, \\\"That settles it. After this New England goes Republican.\\\" FADEOUT.

Handlers of bulk seed probably are more particular in getting varieties best adapted to the locality and season, thus, if possible, buy seed from bulk supplies. 4. Start your planting by running small furrows two to three inches deep and from one to one and a half feet apart. Cabbage should be spaced about 15 to 18 inches apart in the row while celery should be spaced about six inches. Cabbage and celery transplants should be planted at the edge of the furrows, enabling the plants to be watered easily immediately after transplanting. 5. Run a similar furrow alongside your seed furrow. In , the original furrow plant the seed not over three fourths of an inch deep on the ridges.

(U.F) Heinrich Himmler, head of the nazi ges-tapo, has ordered that one-half of the large Jewish population in occupied Poland be exterminated by the end of, the year, reports from the Polish underground movement to the Polish govem-ment-in-exile here said today. The first step in the bloody program, it was said, would be to kill 50 per cent of the thousands of Jews living in ghettoes established by the nazis. The remainder would be liquidated later. THOUSANDS DIE There were 3,113,900 Jews, or 9-8 percent of the total population, in Poland according to the 1931 census, but the Germans during more than three years of occupation have reduced this number by killing thousands outright or permitting them to die of starvation and disease. Special nazi liquidation battalions, 'commanded by members of the notorious SS elite guard, were said to be carrying out Himmlers program. These squads were dragging Jewish victims from their homes or seizing them in streets and driving them to village and town squares in mass roundups for execution, the reports said. Old men and women and cripples were singled out to be herded to cemeteries where they were mowed down by -firing squads, Polish sources said. The nazis made no attempt to prove that the Jews had committed any crimes or violated German regulations. Jews who were not executed immediately, it was reported, were packed into freight cars 150 packed to a car that normally was large enough for 40 to be shipped to undisclosed points for liquidation. SEALED IN CARS The floors of the cars were covered with a thick layer of chlorate of chlorine sprinkled with water and the doors were tightly sealed. In some cases the trains reportedly remained on a siding for two days before departing and many of the Jews died of suffocation. The dead were left in the cars with the living. Polish government quarters said the nazis temporarily were sparing young and relatively healthy Jew's to be used as slave labor. As confirmation of the re ports they cited German figures reportedly announcing that only 40,000 food ration cards were printed for Jews in Poland for October, compared with 130,000 in September. Polish Jews will not be the only ones to suffer from this latest nazi program, since thousands of Jews from Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia and other occupied territories have been transported to Polish ghettoes after having been deprived of virtually all their wealth and personal possessions. v Service Men Invited To Social Evening Ventura units of the Canadian Legion and the British War Relief have invited 50 local service men to be their guests at an entertainment and social evening at the Athene clubhouse at 8 oclock tonight.

Reports from the European continent which, of Into, have reached the exiled governments in London have brought distressing evidence of the severe measures enforced by the German military administration in practically all occupied countries. Therefor, those governments are urging the United States as well as Great Britain and Russia to precipitate 'the course of military operations. Gen. Wladyslaw Si- korski, leader of the Free Polish forces, is commonly believed to have come to this country primarily with that purpose in mind, although while here he has been tending to other matters as well. Obviously, on the side of the United Nations, the men responsible for the strategic leadership of the war cannot so easily depart from the plans worked out m London last July by the combined chiefs of staff, even for the purpose of giving relief .to so many millions trapped by the Nazis.

The case of Poland la perhaps tne most telling of all. The def inite policy upon which Hitler's will seems to have settled once and for all to to exterminate all the Jews in the country and me thodically to decimate the Poles. Even in Franco, where firing squads do not operate on the same seals as in eastern Europe, a sim ilar principle was lately enforced. Men in position of influence whose patriotism never flinched under the pressure of German might are daily being forcibly taken from their homes and sent to remote camps, far beyond French frontiers. Sikorsld To Talk Gen. Slkorski is scheduled to address Polish workmen who, in usiroK ana eisewnere, nave so great a share in the production of war materiel. The tragic side of Europe's fate may bo emphasized in his speeches. Were the conflict to drag on for years, not much would be left, all through the continent, of the recuperative forces. But what about the prospects of the second front already set up in North Africa developing into other second fronts? In Tunisia, at the present time, the line, of supplies available to the Gagman High Command across the Strait of Sicily is much shorter and safer than Anglo-American communications. That privilege commands today the ebb and flow of the struggle on the Tunis-Blzerte front It means that German fighters can be gathered in great numbers close to the battle field, that .the German military machine can easily be refueled on the spot, and that stocks of gasoline are being built up to meet all requirements. Marshal Erwin Rommel has not even tried, in recent weeks, to make greater use for a defensive action of the El Agheila pass- a still 'more restricted ground than the El Alamein defile. The inference is that all the German ma teriel and effectives, detailed for service in North Africa, are intended to accumulate in Tunisia. But, sooner or later, the Allies will have solved the logistics problems with which they now have to contend in the French empire. Then, very arduous tasks will confront their enemies. Gorman military experts are not the men to postpone scheming for the next phase of the war until the North African campaign has actually been ended. Up to a recent date, they never had to ask themselves where British and Americans were going to strike next since they always retained the initiative for themselves. Today, however, their business is to make plans on the assumption that, some day, their European fortress will bo besieged and that the avenues leading to that fortress had better be closed at the earliest.

STOPFELMAN North American Newspaper Alliance NEW YORK. In July. 1942, the German \\\"authorities in the Nether lands began the long-threatened wholesale deportation of all Dutch Jews to the Nazi-made Ghettos of eastern Europe, especially Poland. In almost every town and village Gentile fellow countrymen of those defenseless victims immediately gave whatever assistance they could. At the same time Holland's underground workers printed a pamphlet, and distributed it throughout the land. The complete text of this remarkable document which is now available for the first time, follows: \\\"Fellow countrymen: The de portation of all Jewish citizens be tween the ages of 16 and 42 is the final link in the long chain of in human measures of the last few weeks: The yellow star; the requi sitioning of all bicycles belonging to Jews: the ban on entennz the homfs of non-Jews; the interdiction against the use of the tele phones, trolley cars or trains; the ban on buying in other than Jewish shops and during other than stipulated hours, etc. On July 15, 1942, at 1.30 AM the first group of Jews is to assemble near the central station at Am sterdam. After that date 1200 Jews will he forced to leave daily. From Wester-bark, in Drente, here the unfortunate people will be 'selected.' a minimum of 4000 Jews will be deported at one time. Specialists in this sort ot hangman's work have arrived from Prague to expedite the deportation as much as possible. In all, some 120,000 Jewish Netherlander will be thus eliminated from our coun try. Cool Resume of Facts \\\"This is a cool resume of the facts which in haashness and businesslike efficiency are only paralleled by the orders of the Egyptian Pharaoh who had all Jewish male children killed, and by the action of Herodus the anti-Semite who in order to kill Jesus murdered all infants-in-arms of Bethlehem Now, thousands of years later. Hitler and his henchmen have taken their places in the ranks of those tyrants. \\\"Offlcisl Polish information states that a total of 700,000 Jews have already succumbed to Ger man cruelty. The same fate awaits our Jewish co-citizens. The life of non-Jews working in Ger many is a hard one but when the laborers are Jewish, it means the materialization of the menaces which the Nazis have uttered time and again. It means the complete annihilation of the Jews. \\\"With disgust end indlsnstion the Netherlands people have witnessed the introduction of the anti-Jewish measures. Our nation is paying deeply for not having pro tested against the seemingly innocuous Jewish declaration. (Note: This \\\"Jewish declaration\\\" is evidently the Nazi decree of Jsn. 14. 1941, by which all Dutch Jews were ordered to register within six Weeks' time.) It is our common 3 my savings.

For the previous German measures had one purpose only: To segregate the Jews from all other Dutchmen, to exclude all contact with them and to undermine our sentiments of sympathy and solidarity. \\\"In this they have been more successful than we know and are willing to admit. The Jews are to be quietly wiped out and we, who witness it, are to be deaf, blind and dumb.

Remember the February strikes of 1941 when an enraged people showed what it can do if it wishes to. (Note: The February strikes in 1941 were caused by a large scale attack on Amsterdam's Jews organized by Dutch Nazis and aided by the German green police. They comprised many of the city's vital serviceea as well as a number of large industries.) \\\"We expect that secretaries- general, burgomasters and high officials shall jeopardize their positions by refusing to assist the German occupying power.

      "\"a HIMMLER WILL LIQUIDATE HALF OF POLISH JEWS I I A I Gestapo Already Carrying t . I . I Uut Rule, Government in Exile Says. London, Nov. 24. (United I Press) Heinrich Himmler, head of the Nazi gestapo, has ordered that one-half of the large Jewish population in occupied Poland be I exterminated by the end of the year, reports from the Polish un derground movement to the Polish govemment-tn-exile here said today. The first step in the bloody program, it was said, would be to kill 50 per cent of the thousands of Jews living in ghettoes established by the Nazis. The remainder would be liquidated later. There were 3,113,900 Jews, or 9.8 per cent of the total population, in Poland according to the 1931 census, but the Germans during more than three years of occupa- U.BU muv-c w v.vut-i tion have reduced this number by killing thousands outright or per-1 mitting them to die of starvation I and disease. Special Nazi liquidation bat- talions, commanded by members of the notorious SS Elite guard, were said to be carrying out Himmler's program. These squads were dragging Jewish victims from their homes or seizing them in streets and driving them to village and town square in mass roundups for execution, the reports said. Old men and women and cripples were singled out to be herded to cemeteries, where they were mowed down by firing squads, Polish sources said. The Nazis made no attempt to prove that the 'Jews had committed any crimes or violated German regulations. , Jews who were not executed immediately, it was reported, were packed into freight cars 150 packed to a car that normally was large enough for 40 to be shipped to undisclosed points for liquidation. Many Suffocate. The floors of the cars were covered with a thick layer of lime or chlorine sprinkled with water and the doors were tightly sealed. In some cases the trains reportedly remained on a siding for two days I before departing and many of the Jews died of suffocation. The Japa-dead were left Jh the Cars with the living. ' Polish government quarters said the Nazis temporarily were spar- ing young and relatively healthy prob-Jews to be used as slave labor. As confer-confirmation of the reports they cited German figures reportedly announcing that only 40,000 food ration cards were printed for Jews I in Poland for October, compared with 130,000 in September. . Polish Jews will not be the only al-ones to suffer from this latest Nazi I pogrom, since thousands of Jews I Amer-from Germany, Austria, former Czechoslovakia, and some occu- pied territories have been trans- Jap-ported to Polish ghettoes after j having been deprived of virtually j all their wealth and personal pos- I sessions. . t A\n",

But two and one half years later, when Bormann already ha'd laid claim to an adjutant and large car in the best style of Nazi Big Shots, hla Immediate superior Rudolf Hess conveniently got out of his way by flying to Scotland to woo peace without Hitler's consent. Bormann had prepared his ground well and In fact thought he had Hess on the run anyhow. Rlb- bentrop and Hlmmler were oac tng him. In return for favors dona Tha appointment from muer as successor to Hess came without aurprlse. and In soma quarters not very friendly to Bormann It waa said that be got out the new uniform with Its high rsnklng stupe he'd b-n sretly admiring himself in and walked the length of Unter den Linden to shake hands with any gaping provincial who cared to rocognlze and Idolise him.

present the pamphlet revealed the following current facts of daily life: Health: “Warsaw today is dying out Deprived of the necessary fats and vitamins the population falls easy prey to disease Exhaustion hunger and cold have forced many people to stay permanently in bed” In the first half of 1941 8000 persons were bom in Warsaw but 21800 died In 1941 9000 died of tuberculosis compared with less than 3000 in 1938- In the first eight months of 1941 typhus took a toll of 5592 persons compared to 23 In 1938 ‘‘Children are malformed and ghostlike suffering from anemia and softening of the bones” Cost of living and wages: Cost of living up more than 1100 per cent Wages have fallen below minimums set by pre-war contracts \\\"Warsaw’s working class is poverty stricken” Food: “Bread is about the only thing the Poles can count upon eating This winter there may be no bread in Warsaw Forty per cent sawdust the bread is dark and indigestible” Food cards rarely received theoretically entitle Poles to sub-subsistence amounts of a few Items “Adults may not receive milk an adult being anybody older than six months” Private enterprises: “Germans seized all war industries in Warsaw putting the larger ones to work without delay and taking a little time to fit the smaller ones into their war machine” German trustees (Treuhander) have been in- stalled in businesses stolen from Poles: they exercise complete control boss the former boss' and his workers and receive fancy salaries Light and heat: “Eighty per cent have been without sufficient light and heat since the occupation Gas pressure has been so low it takes several hours to warm a quart of water Without warning sections of the city are completely deprived of electricity often for two or three months at a time” Coal is available only on the Black Market where a half ton costs about $160 Nazis have seized all homes and offices with steam heat For firewood Poles have torn down fences and stripped trees of bark Private property: “The invaders passed a series of legal decrees authorizing themselves to steal all Polish property For weeks on end the covered trucks of the Gestapo rumbled out of Warsaw head for Germany and laden with furniture rugs jewels furs paintings household equipment all manner and description of Polish personal property all seized without payment” Cultural life: All universities and high schools have been closed Scientific laboratories have been dismantled and shipped to Germany Tlie Polish press has been suspended No history geography or Polish literature may be taught in elementary schools No new textbooks are issued and most old ones have been confiscated “Systematically destroying the intellectual classes the Germans forbid teachers writers artists musicians and actors to practice their professions” Gestapo: “Warsaw is really ruled by the Gestapo a law unto itself” Once it became settled in a former ministry on Szucna street “with some one thousand officers and five thousand troops no man’s life could be called his own” Black Markets: There is little doubt that the Germans at a fat profit have a hand in operating Black Markets Few can afford the prices: an egg costs 60 cents a pound of pork around $4 a pound of butter between $9 and $11 Housing: “Thousands of Poles have been expelled from their homes on three days’ notice and been moved to other

A mixed American-Australian column, moving on Buna along the A Japanese cruiser and two do mam island trail met resistance by st royers had been sighted 105 miles a big force of enemy troops about ! west of our base on Guadalcanal, five miles from Buna and two and We took off late in the afternoon one-half miles from Sanananda, up Grumman Avenger fighters, tor- jpedo planes and Douglas Dauntless dive bombers. I was flying one of the torpedo planes, but for this operation it was loaded with bombs. The weather was clear and hot. While we were gaining altitude, I heard a pilot report to the Guadalcanal control tower that he had sighted 15 Zeros in the vicinity of the island. Our formation was alone in the sky. Very nervous, I tried hard to remember what to do should the Zeros attack. the coast. The allied troops fanned out on botli sides of the trail into the jungles and, thrusting in behind the Japanese, established positions between the enemy and Sanananda. Yesterday the enemy troops realized their danger and tried to break through to safety. They attacked again and again, only to be beaten back. \\\"Southward of Sanananda the enemy repeatedly counterattacked, Gen- ... , ...

Then I realized we were in a lough spot. I saw a Zero swinging in to attack from the port (left) side. I kicked the plane into a turn. Hicks shouted: I got him. My heart was in my throat, but I circled around toward the cruiser again, thinking I could climb through his smoke and drop one from low altitude on his deck. By this time the cruiser was smoking badly amidships and listing to port.! We were only 800 yards from the cruiser when my gunner began strafing its deck. Then the cruiser opened up on us. I could hear the staccato of its guns as we roared past. Bullets spattered the water like rain. Twenty Holes in Tail. Suddenly they found our range. Tracers were looping toward us through smoke.

(A1) The commander in chief of the United States fleet, Admiral Ernest J. King, stood on the battle-scarred deck of the cruiser San Francisco today and in brief ceremony presented the Congressional Medal of Honor to Commander Bruce McCandless, who directed the flagship in a great battle off Savo island a month ago. Admiral King, chief of naval 'op-erations, came here from Washington, D. C., to congratulate the crew of the San Francisco, the ship that led a task force through two columns of Jap ships in the Solo mons November 13. The San Franciscos own guns sank a cruiser and a destroyer, and damaged a Jap battleship so critically it was sunk next day. Only 31 years old, Commander McCandless of Long Beach, Calif., found himself in command of the cruiser after a shell through the bridge had killed his senior officers. Knocked Out Twice. The citation was for distinguished service above and beyond the call of duty. Admiral King said that MeCand- less, although seriously wounded and twice knocked unconscious, used \\\"superb initiative in continuing to lead the flagship against \\\"overwhelming powerful forces, and that he boldly continued to engage the enemy. The admiral declared that the San Francisco made port due, in large measure, \\\"to the great seamanship and the great courage\\\" of McCandless. Thousands of San Franciscans stood on a neighboring pier as the ceremony was conducted. Command was handed down successively from Rear Admiral Daniel Callaghan through 11 officers, and by the moment's peculiar demands, finally came to McCandless. Admiral Callaghan, Captain Cas-sin Young and three commanders were the senior officers. All but one commander was killed. He was badly wounded. McCandless was senior surviving officer on the bridge. The command passed automatically to the senior lieutenant commander, H. E. Schonland of Portland, Me. But he w'as deep in the ship, directing damage control work, and sent this word to McCandless: \\\"I have a hell of a lot of water to take care of. If you need any help, let me know.

Stimson Says African Task Is Still in Opening Stages E (Continued from page one.) The Itrlian high command's war bulletin, without supporting details, reported today that British armored attacks had been warded off in Libya. For their part, the Germans, frustrated in their drive upon al-lied-held Medjez el Bab, 35 miles southwest of Tunis, said today that in new thrusts stubborn allied defenders had been wiped out at a bridgehead south of the Medjerda river, which bisects- the Mateur-Tebourba line in Tunisia. Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower, however, continued to gather his forces In the muddy hills and the allied spokesman was optimistic that an overwhelming allied striking force would be in position to push the Germans back to the sea In due time. \\\"The enemy has been able to get appreciable men and materials from Sicily, he said. General Anderson (Lieutenant General K. A. N. Anderson, commander of the British First army) can not commit himself to a major battle until he is certain of winning.\\\" There were no clarifying reports on the situation in the Mateur-Tcbourba area, but the allied salient which once jutted eastward like a horseshoe from the two towns had disappeared. The allied line now was almost straight, the spokesman said, and there apparently had been a withdrawal in the Tebourba region. Many observers in London, however, believed that the territory between Tebourba and Medjez el Bab, a distance of about 20 miles, now was a, no man's land.\\\" Vichy Report. The Vichy radio reported early today that German forces were maintaining their pressure against allied positions southwest of Tebourba. Both sides are hampered by bad weather and sticky mud, which was; described as even worse than the mud of the Somme in the first World war. It has hampered movement on both sides, but helps the allies to some extent by giving them a chance to build up strength, the spokesman said. The Morocco radio broadcast a communique from French general headquarters in North Africa claiming the Germans suffered heavy losses in infantry in the Medjez el Bab fighting. About half of the 15 tanks employed by the Germans were damaged, the communique said. Another french communique reported that offensive reconnaissances west of Kairouan progressed as planned. Kairouan is about 28 miles west of the main road between Sousse and Sfax and 35 miles from the Mediterranean coast. German Report. The German high command said today that a United States destroyer was sunk by a U-boat off Oran and that a British destroyer was sunk in a naval engagement in the English channel last night. These claims were not confirmed from any other source. Light German naval units accounted for the British destroyer in the channel and also set fire to a motor torpedo boat, the high command said.

MONROVIA, Liberia, Dec. 12.

Mission at Dakar. NEW YORK, Dec. 12. OP) The Dakar radio, heard here by CBS, reported today that a United States military mission, headed by Brigadier General Shepler W. Fitzgerald, had arrived yesterday at Dakar for a 48-hour visit. This apparently was a step toward ironing out final terms for making Dakar an allied port and possibly adding French war vessels there to the fleets of the United Nations under the decision of Pierre Boisson. governor general of French West Africa, to open the port and Its airfields to allied use.

A. F. raid on the Phillips Wireless Valve and Radio works at Eindhoven, The Netherlands, last Sunday. WASHINGTON, Dec. 13. (P) Emphasizing that the North African campaign is merely beginning, Secretary of War Stimson declared today that \\\"the main and big work still remains to be done when steps can be completed to give us air supremacy. When that air superiority is obtained, he said, three objectives lie ahead: 1. To expel or destroy axis forces in Tunisia. 2. To attack Tripoli and destroy the Germans under Rommel by getting behind him. 3. To cooperate with the British in making the North African coast and the Mediterranean a safer line reaching to the Egyptian area. Stimson said light forces of both the allies and the axis now are engaging in what might be described as feeling out the enemy. At the same time, he continued. United States units not only are gaining valuable experience in their frontal contacts with the enemy, but are forestalling any German attempts' to improve the enemys positions. Ahead of Schedule. Stimson told his press conference that two events calm weather on a normally stormy front and the orders of Admiral Jean Darlan for the laying down of French arms contributed greatly to success in North Africa. Darlan's action, he said, could not have been anticipated and, to-, gether with the fortunate calm weathoy put the campaign \\\"about a month ahead of schedule. Stimson contrasted the North African campaign with the Japanese drive through the south Pacific, saying Japan had adjacent air, land and sea forces to support moves against Indo-China, the Philippines, Singapore, Borneo, Java, New Guinea and the Solomons. Conditions Reversed. In the African campaign those conditions, he said, were precisely reversed. A \\\"very powerful enemy, he said, controlled Europe and islands in the Mediterranean and control of the Mediterranean was divided and in dispute. \\\"So at North Africa, a surprise was absolutely necessary and that was the only way it could be a success, the secretary said. By very careful and successful planning,\\\" he added, coupled with extraordinary luck and fortune we achieved a wonderful surprise attack. Swift Thrust Imperative. He told of American light forces racing ahead although there were not sufficient air fields and mechanical preparations to permit a step-by-step campaign such as that of the Japanese in the south Pacific. We knew that if we didn't succeed the Germans could come over a narrow part of the Mediterranean in full force and dig in, Stimson said. The light armored forces, he continued, would not in such a case be adequately protected from air but those flight forces could slow up the enemy drive while preparations for aerial warfare were made. That is the slate we have reached today, he said. lie said that most of the attacking force in movement thus far has been British but that some American Hoops have been \\\"getting a chance to overcome buck fever on being up against the strongest nation in the world on land. Yank Planes Good. Stimson also said that American planes have made \\\"a good showing and shown themselves at least! equal to the enemy planes of Germany. As an example, he said that in the week ended December 5, allied air forces destroyed 42 axis planes and probably destroyed 10 others with only 17 losses. Returning to the opportunity lot? American troops to overcome buck fever, Stimson described as one of the most gratifying features the chance that came to a small armored task force a week ago on El Gusse ridge. The Germans had counterattacked on the British First army, one line coming in from the northeast and one from the southeast. They were meeting considerable success in driving back the First army, hut in doing so placed one flank of the attack abreast a small American task force. That force, SMmson said, \\\"rushed in with sueh vigor and such success that it destroyed the whole German attack and sent the enemy back, regaining the ridge. lie warned against overoptimism, saying that the initial success in North Africa brought a \\\"tremendous upsurge i- public opinion and a tendency to say the whole thing's over except the shouting', Nothing could be more untrue, Stimson said. King of Egypt Gives to the Yanks WASHINGTON, Dec. 12. UP) The state department said today that the king of Egypt has made a Christmas gift of 2000 Egyptian pounds (approximately $8000) to the American forces in Egypt. President Roosevelt, the department said, has sent this message in response: \\\"The American minister at Cairo has informed me of your majestys generous gift to the American forces in Egypt on .he occasion of the approaching holiday season. In expressing my personal appreciation of your majesty's generosity, I express also the gratitude of the American people for this gracious contribution to the happiness- of men of the American armed forces in jou1- majesty's hospitable country. \\\"I wish to take this opportunity to extend my best wishes for the personal happiness of your majesty and for the w ell-being of the people of Egypt.''\n",

I, CANBERRA, Australia, Dee. 10, (A3) -- Prime Minister John Curtin told the house of representatives In a war review today that President Koosevell and Prime Minister Churchill decided even betore the fall of Singapore that their first task was the defeat of Germany. That decision, he said, involved Australia in what essentially at piesent is a holding campaign. Singapoie fell last February 15. Australia, with all the help she can obiain from the outside, must be prepared to hang on until the maximum allied strength can be concentrated against Japan, Curtin said. He warned the nation it must be prepared to repulse strong air and sea-borne attacks from Japanese concentrated on the island of Timor, to the north. Powerful Enemy. In facing such a powerful and determined enemy as Japan, the prime minister went on, \\\"we must ho prepared to make any sacrifices enabling us lo match and overcome a foe so thoroughly trained in the both neis in some sectois, they ! needs of war.

Soviets Claim a Seven-Mile Advance Along Central Front By EDDIE GILMORE. MOSCOW, Dec. 10. (P)' The red army has speared seven miles deeper into enemy lines on the central front near Velikie Luki,' recapturing 13 settlements, while the Germans still have failed in their six-day effort to regain the initiative on the Stalingrad front, Soviet dispatches reported today. Attacking with ski troopers supported by tanks painted white to blend with the snow, the Russians apparently are stabbing at Nazi communications on the central front which extends northwest of Moscow roughly from Rzhev to Velikie Luki. On the Stalingrad front, although slowed down by violent German counterattacks during the last several days, the Russians were reported still pushing gradually forward as their offensive there entered its fourth week. They Stand Firm. Although axis forces have been separated on the western banks of the Volga tfnd Don and driven fiom Soviet forces which had cut a highway. Dispatches from the front said that the Russians repulsed several counterattacks, and threw their ski . batteries, wrecked two cl 1 tians and dispcrsee land p , mhilated a bultn inn 0 infantry. Twenty-four Geiman planes weie destroyed in the Stalingrad area yesterday, the communique noted. W ipeil Out, Is Claim. BERLIN (Fiom German Brand-casts), Dec. 10. (A5) The Gorman communique said today that Russian forces had broken into German lines between the Volga and Don rivers but declared they had been surrounded and wiped out. The Russians were described as continuing their offensive with heavy losses. In two days on the Stalingrad front 104 Russian tanks weie reported destroyed. German infantry and tank forces were said to have driven the Russians back and repelled red army counterattacks in some parts of the Don bend. 4 (r , ) FOR (LW -a'T'N-arv' iMUlTARYiiMEN (BLOCK-SIS AY TOPS IN SERVICE TOPS IN QUALITY TOPS IN STYLE LOW IN PRICE 719 W.

Nov. 24 U.R Heinrich Hlmmler, head of the nazi geslapo. has ordered that one-nan 01 me large Jewish population in occupied Poland be exterminated by the end of the year, reports from the Polish underground movement to the Polish government-ln-exile here said today. The first step in the bloody program, it was said, would be to kill 50 per cent of the thousands of Jews living in ghettos established by the nazis. The remainder would be \\\"liquidated\\\" later. There were 3,113,900 Jews, or 9.8 per cent of the total population, in Poland according to the 1931 census, but the Germans during more than three years of occupation have reduced this number by killing thousands outright or permitting them to die of starvation and disease. Carry Out Program Special nazi \\\"liquidation\\\" battalions, commanded by members of the notorious SS elite guard, were said to be carrying out Himmler's program. These squads were dragging Jewish victims from their homes or seizing them in street and driving them to village and town squares in mass roundups for execution, the report said. Old men and women and cripples Were singled out to be herded to cemeteries where they were mowed down by firing squads, Polish sources said. The nazis made no attempt to prove that the Jews had committed any crimes or violated German regulations. Packed In Freight Cars Jews who were not executed immediately, it was reported, were packed Into freight cars 150 packed to a car that normally was large enough for 40 to be shipped to undisclosed points for liquidation. The floors of the cars were covered with a thick layer of lime or chlorine sprinkled with water and the doors were tightly sealed. In nm cusps the trains rerjortedlv re mained on a siding for two days Deiore departing, ana many oi me jews died or suirocation. The dead were left in the cars with the living.

Mayor Fred Craig and Lieut. Alex Watson, Gooding, helped In the VENEREAL RATE IN By HOWARD W. BLAKESLEE Associated Presa Science Editor WASHINGTON, Nov. 24 The rate of venereal disease in the American army In the United States has been falling ever since Pearl Harbor. The decrease breaks all American military records, in war or peace. It signalizes a change of wider significance in Its promise to carry over to peacetime Into a new high of national health. For the home, folks are beginning to cooperate with the army and navy to make venereal disease control primarily a public health measure, a medical job instead of only a political football and a moral issue. Lowest Rate The army rates cannot be published, due to war department requests. But the broad facts are available. In this army, the highest venereal, rate never has been up to the lowest of the World war. That war in turn was way under the Civil war. The drop which began after Pear! Harbor is considered mainly due to medical rather than patriotic and psychological reason. Pearl Harbor coincided with completion of medical organization, which placed a venereal disease control officer In every military encampment. The work of these officers quickly showed results. Their main weapon was curbs on commercial prostitution, hitting at the profits of men and women operators who procured girls, and at the graft protecting them. Federal Act Also at the officers' disposal, and invoked twice to date, is the May act. This law makes commercial prostitution a federal offense in areas near military encampments, when so designated by the secretary of war or the secretary of the navy. The act was adopted by congress In July, 1941. Under the act, engaging In prostitution or aiding it are punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 or one year's imprisonment, or both.

Eden did not elaborate on his statement. * * * Allied spokesmen, however, repeatedly have pointed out that the relatively light resistance from the French was only the first phase and that the showdown for domination of the Mediterranean's African shore would be the 'test, now developing, between the allies and the stronger defenses of the axis. * * * Those spokesmen have stressed that political arrangements in North Africa were intended to free allied military commanders there for their main job and that, in that sense, political and military operations were closely dovetailed. The Eden statement was made while he was commenting for the second day on the cancelation by Prime Minister Churchill of a broadcast which Gen. Charles De- Gaulle had scheduled for Jast Saturday. \\\"The prime minister and I did not think its delivery at this particular time would be helpful to the extremely tense and serious operations now proceeding in Tunisia,\\\" Eden said.

Australian troops found 100 Japanese dead in a single village, and other Japanese bodies strewn along the sands. Every available Allied plane sent skimming in low-level attacks over the Japanese positions with machine-guns and cannons blazing. No Japanese appeared to challenge the assault, dispatches said. On the China war front, U.

Long-range American P-38 fighters ranged the skies above the ground troops, seeking out German and Italian concentrations, attacking troop columns and trains and occasionally engaging Axis planes.

Six-Month Delay in Gasoline Rationing Urged by Committee Of House; Jeff ers Stands Pat WASHINGTON, D.

M.), chairman of a sub-committee of a 15-man committee created at a bi-partisan anti-rationing caucus of house members last week, made public the recommendations at a house interstate commerce committee hearing. Representative Martin of Massachusetts, the house Republican leader, today called a meeting of New England senators and representatives for next Tuesday morn ing to discuss \\\"the eastern oil situation.\\\" An announcement by Martin's office said New Englanders were especially interested in \\\"prevent ing people from freezing to death. Jeffers \\\"Stands Pat\\\" Protests against nation-wide gasoline rationing drenched the capital today but Rubber Administrator William M. Jeffers declared the program stands. Dec. 1 remains the effective date. After hearing Jeffers yesterday, members of a house interstate sub-committee said privately it appeared that little could be done to avert the move. They referred to Jeffers' declaration that rationing was not necessary to conserve gasoline outside the east but was essential for the conservation of rubber, stocks of which, he said, might reach a dangerous low next year. Chairman Truman (D., Mo.) of the special senate defense investigating committee announced that Jeffers. Secretary Harold L. Ickes, Defense Transportation Director Joseph B. Eastman and Price Administrator Leon Henderson had been directed to appear Friday to establish the need for rationing. Conceding that there was no shortage of gasoline in the west and middlewest, Jeffers reminded the house committee that \\\"a car will burn up as much rubber in Soviet Jaws Close on Nazis Oklahoma, for example, as it will in Maine.\\\" \\\"Our problem is to keep the cars running,\\\" he added. Sees Improvement In 1944 If present plans materialize, he told the committee, the outlook for 1944 will be encouraging, for in that year synthetic rubber production is expected to reach 800,-000 tons, or 200,000 tons more than normal peacetime requirements.

Reveal Hitler Plans to Exterminate All Jews in Occupied Areas by End of i 1912; 2,000,000 Already Slaughtered WASHINGTON, D. C.-(AP)-Details of a campaign which Dr. Stephen S. Wise said was planned to exterminate all Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe by the end of the year are to be laid before a committee of leading Jewish organizations today in New York. The story which Dr. Wise said was confirmed by the state department and a personal representative of President Roosevelt deals with how more than 2,-000,000 Jews already have been slaughtered in accordance with a race extinction order by Adolf Hitler. Before leaving for New York to address the committee this afternoon, Dr. Wise, chairman of the World Jewish Congress and president of the American Jewish Congress, said he carried official documentary proof that \\\"Hitler had ordered the extermination of all Jews in Nazi-ruled Europe in 1942.\\\" After a consultation with state department officials, he announced they had termed authentic certain sources which revealed that ee Trapping Of Big Army At Stalingrad Germans Are in \\\"Awful\\\" Military Position, Says London Source; Hitler Has Lost 100,000 Dead or Captured LONDON. (AP) The Nazi besiegers of Stalingrad are In an \\\"awful\\\" military position, compelled to withdraw from the Volga city through a menaced, curving corridor of Russian armies and to cross the Don river if they are to get free of the Soviet grip, a British military source said today. This informant, who must remain anonymous, added, however, that there was no confirmation here that the Germans had ordered a general withdrawal from Stalingrad. He said any German counter-attack to relieve the menaced army would be \\\"tremendously difficult.\\\" This informant pointed out that the Russian offensive may prove to be the first major land action of the war not accompanied by heavy air fighting. Two possible reasons, he said, might be unfavorable weather or the diversion of much German air strength to North Africa. BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS German losses in dead and captured alone had rocketed close to 100,000, as the Russian counter-offensive gained momentum and squeezed the invaders' escape corridoTfrom Stalingrad down to a width of 30 miles, battlefront dispatches reported today. From the long-besieged city the Russians reported rolling back a Nazi wedge to the Volga, clearing another avenue for supply and reinforcement of the garrison which already is lashing out from its defensive positions and beating back the Nazis street-by-street. Northwest of the city the Russian offensive penetrated 80 miles into the depth of German defenses within the great Don bend, and to the southwest the Russians had stabbed 65 miles Attack by Mob Is Fatal to Doriot, French Pro-Nazi LONDON (UP) The London Evening Standard reported today that Jacques Doriot, the radical pro-Nazi French leader of Paris, has died, presumably of injuries suffered in a beating he received at the hands of a mob which attacked him about a week ago.

There, he said Nazi doctors were killing them at the rate of \\\"more than 100 men an hour, per doctor,\\\" by injecting air bubbles into their veins \\\"The simplest and cheapest method\\\" they could find.

The jaws of the nutcracker still were closing. A communique added 3,400 more German dead overnight to the toll In the Stalingrad-Don bend sector alone, raising the official count of the killed to 44,400 in six days, and battlefront dispatches said the tally when all reports were in would be close to 50,000. The communique gave no specific figure on Germans captured overnight, but dispatches said the previous total of 36,000 now, too, was probably close to 60,000. (No official figures 'were given on the number of Nazi wounded, but in London a Reuters dispatch from Moscow estimated by the traditional ratio of three wounded for every soldier killed that the wounded totaled 120,000.) Soviet communiques reported both rail supply lines to the siege forces cut early in the offensive which started seven days ago and today's front line dispatches indicated that only a narrow strip running through the Don river elbow north of Kalach and south of Trekho-Strovskaya remained open to an estimated 300,000 Germans and their allies for moving supplies, or escaping. The Russians have succeeded in \\\"temporarily penetrating\\\" Nazi positions on the Rzhev front, west of Moscow, and have reached a point west of the rail center of Toropets, German broadcasts disclosed today.

There were 3.113.900 Jews, or 9.8 per cent of the total population, in Poland according to the 1031 census, but the Germans during more than throe years of occupation have reduced this number by killing thousands outright or permitting them to die of starvation and disease. Many Slaughtered Special nazi \\\"liquidation\\\" battalions, commanded by members of the notorious SS elite guard, were said to be carrying out Himmler's program. These squads were dragging Jewish victims Irom their homes or seizing them in streets and driving them to village and town squares in mass roundups lor execution, the reports said. Old men and women and cripples were singled out to be herded to cemeteries where they were mowed down by firing squads. Polish sources said. The nazis made no attempt to prove that the Jews had committed any crimes or violated German regulations. Jews who were not executed immediately, Jt was reported, were packed into freight cars 150 packed to a car tharnormally was large enough for 40 to be shipped to undisclosed points for liquidation. Dead Left in Cars The floors of the cars were covered with a thick layer of chlorate of lime sprinkled with water and the doors were tightly sealed. In some cases the trains reportedly remained on a siding for two days before departing, and many of the - Jews died of suffocation. The dead were left in the cars with the living. Polish government quarters said the nazis temporarily were sparing young and relatively healthy Jews to be used as slave labor. As confirmation of the reports they cited German figures reportedly announcing that only 40.000 food ration cards were printed for Jews in Poland for October, compared wih 130.000 in September. Other Jews Included Polish Jews will not be the only ones to suffer from this latest nazi program, since thousands of Jews from Germany, Austria, former Czechoslovakia and some occupied territories have been transported to Polish ghettoes after having been deryived of virtually all their wealth and personal possessions.\n",

Wise, chairman of the World Jewish Congress and president of the American Jewish Congress, said he carried official documentary proof that “Hitler has ordered the extermination of all Jaws in Nazi- ruled Europe in 1942.” After a consultation with state department officials, he announced they had termed authentic certain sources which revealed that approximately half of the estimated 4,000,000 Jews in Nazi- occupied Europe already had been killed and that Hitler was wrathful at “failure to complete the extermination immediately.” To speed the slaughter of the other half during the remaining month before the edict’s deadline, Dr. Wise said the Nazis were moving some four-fifths of the Jews in Hitler-ruled European countries to Poland. There, he said, Nazi doctors were killing them at the rate of “more than 100 men an hour, per doctor,” by injecting air bubbles into their veins—“the simplest and cheapest method” they could find.\n",

In some cases the trains reportedly remained on a siding for two days before departing, and many of the - Jews died of suffocation. The dead were left in the cars with the living. Polish government quarters said the nazis temporarily were sparing young and relatively healthy Jews to be used as slave labor. As confirmation of the reports they cited German figures reportedly announcing that only 40.000 food ration cards were printed for Jews in Poland for October, compared wih 130.000 in September.

The first step in the bloody program, it was said, would be to 50 per cent of- the thousands of Jews living in ghettos established by the nazis. The remainder would be \\\"liquidated\\\" later. Die-of Sjtassatiair:;-.-.--^*- There were 3,113,900 Jews, or 9.8 per cent of the total population, in Poland according to the 1931 census, but the Germans during more than three years of occupation have reduced this number by killing thousands outright or permitting them to die of starvation and disease. ' Special nazi \\\"liquidation\\\" battalions, commanded by members of the notorious SS elite guard, were said to be carrying out ler'g program. These squads were dragging Jewish victims from their homes or seizing them -in streets and driving them to village and town squares in mass roundups for execution, the report said. Herded to Cemeteries Old men and women and cripples were singled out to be herded to cemeteries where they were mowed down by firing squads, Polish sources said. The nazis Â·made -no attempt to prove that the Jews had committed any crimes or violated German regulations. Jews who were not executed immediately, it was reported, were packed into freight cars--150 packed to a car that normally was large enough for 40--to be shipped to undisclosed points for liquidation. The floors-of the cars were covered with a thick layer of lime or chlorine sprinkled with water and the doors were tightly, sealed. In some cases the trains reportedly remained on a siding for two days before departing, and many of the Jews died of suffocation. The dead were left in the cars with the living. Those surviving are sent to special camps at Treb- linka, Belzec and Sobibor. Once there they are mass-murdered.\\\"\n",

      "\"Rofarians Honor 'Boys In Service' Patriotic Address Features Program Jackson Rotarians honored \\\"the boys in service\\\" yesterday with a Christmas program featured by comments Irom members who have boys in the armed forces. - -Highlight of the program was a talk by Swanee Lawrence follow-ing brief remarks by Captain W. T. tPeter) Pate, who has a young son in the service. Text of Mr. Lawrence's address follows: \\\"Did you ever spend an hour with yourself? Draw within your shell for one of those moody period of retrospection, introspection and prospection. This happened to me one Sunday evening recently. I sat in the comfort and security of my home alone. After meditating on things that had been and things to come, I turned on the radio and heard a description of Hitler's methods of subjugating the peoples of Europe. At Abbeville, outright mass murder until the German population and ideology were preponderant. In Greece, it was whole sale, slow starvation. Even cattle of the fields are fattened before slaughter and accorded a merciful, quick death. In Poland and Czechoslovakia, it was deportation of a part of the population to typhus infected camps and areas and death by disease and unmentionable personal atrocities. The Jews were robbed, starved, scat-! tered and killed in ghettoes and! concentration camps in a campaign of extermination. Firing squads in other countries killed hundreds of innocent hostages. A land where they have stooped so low as to make even the virtue of their own women a pawn of war. Chastity is cheap and marriage is a mockery and it is a vice to be virtuous. The home is a hatchery for war. The Church has been scuttled. The Bible has seen a black-out. Mein Kampf is their lamp. Religion is a relic of the old order and relegated to the limbo of antiquity. The soul is the shackled slave of the state. \\\"It is a waste of breath to discuss the morals and standards of conduct of those treacherous, barbaric, black-hearted, pagan-minded, slant-eyed rats of the Pacific. \\\"As I sat and listened. I wondered if it would ever come about that my family would be torn asunder 'and cast to the four winds of the earth and become the victims of mass murder, or misuse and abuse and of such hellish flendlshness. Was Voltaire right when he said \\\"history is little else than a picture of human crimes and misfortunes?\\\" \\\"I sometimes look down into the blue eye3 of my two little grandsons and wonder what life has in store for them. \\\"I am a staunch believer in the eternal and incontrovertible law of retribution. 'Be not deceived. God is not mocked. Whatsoever a man soweth. that shall he also reap.' That applies to nations and Individuals alike. He that soweth the wind, shall reap the whirlwind. Those that live by the sword, shall die by the sword. \\\"As we stand today in mental uncertainty, perhaps in spiritual confusion, seemingly af the crossroads of civilization, may we remember that as the ceaseless centuries flow Into eternity. Hitler and his cohorts are but pimples on the face of time. Robert Browning said: God Is in his heaven and all is right with the world. \\\"Then, as I sat alone. I picked up the Reader's Digest and read an article by Raymond Clapper. Its subject was Watch out for Dictatorship Period. The gist of it was that if Congress does not recover its sense of responsibility and Independence from such selfish pressure groups as the ravenous farm, silver and labor groups, it will be no more capable of dealing with reconstruction than it is capable of dealing with war problems. When the gluttonous appetite of the government octopus more that consumes the nations earnings, then we stand face to face with disaster, revolution and chaos Clapper stated: Dictatorships rise out of the decayed ruins of parliamentary government and when bankruptcy and chaos prevail, the people, like a strong man to save them as they did when they turned to Mr. Roosevelt in 1933 to save them from revolution and chaos. Then they welcome a dictator. Such happened in Italy, Germany and Russia. \\\"Well, this is a rather gloomy soIUoqy at this Christmas time, t don't knew what the future holds for us. I thank God that I live in Afnerica. VTo me. the closest and most vivid .example of the goodness of this great country is myself, if you will pardon a personal reference.

Others have given and are giving their lives that we might enjoy happiness and freedem. For our country, may we have the spirit to transmit this Indebtedness of gratitude at a like price to generations unborn; that there might be preserved the blessings of freedom. Nations have risen and nations have fallen since the beginning of time. The problem of self-government is still unsolved. In our country, we may have eld deals and new deals and raw deaU and misdeals but with it all, come what may, right or wrong, this is my native land and my lot is with America always. \\\"I think it appropriate at this time to re-appraise the words of Abraham Lincoln in his second inaugural address, March 4th 18S3. when he spoke as follows: \\\"With malice toward none; with tharitv for all: with firmness in the right as Gcd gives us to see tne Tiem let us strive on to ximsn the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for nun who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his ornhan. to da all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace amcng ourselves and with all nations. \\\"1942 years ago, the wise men of the east visited Jerusalem, to see the babe of Bethlehem.

Hitler, according to the report, demanded that all Jews in Germany and the occupied countries be sent to certain regions in eastern Europe where they shall be \\\"exterminated in one stroke in order to solve once and for all the Jewish question in Europe.\\\" Figures presented in the report showed that of the 200,000 Jews who lived in Germany at the outbreak of the war. only 40,000 remain. Out of 75.000 Jews in Austria at that time, only 15.000 remain and of 80.000 in Bohemia and Moravia, only 15,000 remain.

Some of the Jews fled into the territory formerly occupied by the Russians but were later trapped when it was captured by the Germans. The Hitler decree to annihilate all Jews goes even further than an order issued by Nazi Gestapo Chief Heinrich Himmler late in November. As reported by the Polish government in London, Himmler's order was that half of the remaining Jews in Poland must be killed by the end of the year.

Shortly after Campbell had re minded the defendants, in his opinion, that they had had a \\\"fair trial, a thing of the past in the country tncy sougnt to oeiriena, their attorney, Paul Warnholtz started the American wheels of justice moving again, this time toward consideration by the U. S. Supreme court of the treason case. In filing notice of an appeal, Warnholtz criticized as faulty the Indictments on which the defendants were convicted. He com- lained of the method of present-lg evidence and challenged the verdict of the jury as the result of passion and war hysteria. CASE TO HIGHER COURT Warnholtz said he would seek to have the case reviewed by the Supreme court should he fall to obtain a reversal in appellate court. The U. S. Court of Appeals does not convene until January 11 and Supreme court action would neces sitate a stay of execution for the three men. i In a three-page opinion concluding the nation's largest trial for treason, the only constitutional crime, which in this case was a by-product of the ill-fated nazl saboteur invasion of the United States, Campbell said: \\\"It is the court's duty in sentencing these defendants to make sure that the punishment meted out to them will act as a timely and solemn warning to all who would attempt to commit the smallest act of sabotage. \\\"Likewise the sentence must Rerve notice upon the enemy that the cunningly devised scheme for the use1 of American citizens of German birth as pawns in the game of sabotage and espionage In this country is doomed to failure.\\\" FREE TO CRY NOW The six defendants sat in silence as Judge Campbell pronounced sentence. Two Navy doctors and special deputies stood behind the women with stimulants, but they did not break down in the courtroom. Outride, in the corridor, Mrs. Erna Haupt, mother of the executed saboteur, said: \\\"Now we can cry all we want to.\\\"- Mrs. Kate Wergln already was weeping silently. Mrs. Lucile Froeh-linK stared steadily ahead. The six were arrested on June 28. the day after the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced the capture of eiRht. saboteurs who landed on the east coast by submarine. Herbert Haupt, son of two of the defendants, was one of the eight.

Mr. Winn spoke on the \\\"Federal Revenue Act of 1942\\\" in a program arranged by the vocational service committee. Dr. J. Dechard Guess Introduced the speaker. The bill, he said, although tremendous In its Implications is an \\\"ex cellent one\\\". It is not punitive as have been some bills in the past, a genuine effort being made to light en the burden of certain classes and spread the burden evenly, Mr. wmn said. Outstanding changes in ascertain ing net income. Mr. Winn listed as follows: Any profit made by the discharge. of indebtedness of a corporation no longer constitutes taxable income. The recovery of bad debts is no longer taxable income. There is a deduction for extrava gant medical expenses. He said that at least nine billion dollars would be realized from the act, sorely needed if \\\"our children and our children's children are not to be burdened with paying the cost of this war\\\", and that the act would curb inflation. \\\"The new revenue act sets a precedent which will make for a more logical taxation program in the future, he said. On the other hand, he said, the taxation program would \\\"sorely press many people\\\", and would low er the nation's standard of living. Lowering the standard of living would not necessarily mean a lowering of the standards of life, he said. Sgt. C. Rov Babb, Jr., was introduced by Dr. Charles H. Nabers, the president, who presided.

Wise's statement that I about half the 4.000,000 Jews in Nazi sub- : jugated territory have been slain, and that mainder, was based, he said, on sources of information which the state department had confirmed as authentic. The estimate may be subject to revision, but not the import of the statement. The studied, deliberate and frankly barbarian policy of the Nazis is to rid their world of Jews. Their political defense of this mass murder is the precedent set by the Russian Reds in \\\"liquidating\\\" 3.000.000 landed farmers, known as kulaks. What the Nazis fail to see, however, is that this .slaughter is one of the reasons why the enlightened world is determined to kill 4,000,000 Hitlerite Germans or more if necessary to protect all minorities from a like fate. The people of the United Nations are not only horrified by this bestial depravity. They are so fearful of the probability that a victorious Germany would try to exterminate all its opponents that they prefer death to life under Nazi rule. The Nazi extermination of Jews encourages the United Nations war effort in another way. It proves to manful men that the Nazis are cowards. They are so afraid of a negligible minority among them that extermination is necessary to their security. The subjugated Jews thus have become the instrument of a revelation that will assure and hasten the extermination of their persecutors. Their martyrdom inspires the whole world of free men to win the war at any cost.\n",

Tax Commlasioner John Gray said Is year's levy will raise, on paper, ,865,522 which is $482.762 less than u spread for 1941. A trifle more an 70 per cent of the current levy set aside for debt service. Gray said the assessed valuation, ;atnst which to apply the direct operty tax levy this year, shows i Increase of $21,679,140.

Lowest Since 1MO This is the lowest general fund vy since 1920 when that figure was iced at 1.044 mills. It also is the ilrd lowest general fund levy In story.of the state. In 1919 it was Â«ed at 1.7025. Gray explained the general fund vy was reduced because there was surplus in the fund which finances ineral state businesses which are rt operated on monies ear-marked r law. The cash balance in the North akota general fund on last June I, was $2,720,997, compared with a 1,213,870 balance in that fund on me 30,1941.

Believe Hitler Shifting Planes From Russ Front LONDON-JP-The scale of Axis air attacks in North Africa was reported authoritatively Wednesday to show that Adolf Hitler is backing the enemy land forces with great air power for a bitter-end stand on the Mediterranean shore --probably even to the extent of draining planes from his imperilled Russian front. Strongest enemy ground concentrations are believed to be those holding defensive arcs some 30 miles outside Tunis and Bizerte and in flight before Britain's Eighth army in Libya, although the Vichy radio reported strong formations landing at Oabes and Sfax in Southern Tunisia. American, British and French forces are reported roaming the length and breadth of TttnWa, clashing occasionally with enemy patrols In short bvt violent engagements and preparing for final showdown with the Axis in Africa. The assertion that Hitler probably is weakening his air forces in Russia to bolster those in the Mediterranean area came from an authority whose name can not be disclosed, but it was supported by a dispatch from Algiers, where an Australian correspondent, J o h n Jarvie, telegraphed that he had learned that an Axis squadron that raided North African tÂ»wns Tuesday was on the Stalingrad front three weeks ago.

Lt. Register Tells NBC Radio Audience How He Bogged 8 Planes at Guadalcanal How he shot down eight Japanese planes from the skies over Guadalcanal was described by Lt. Francis Register of Bismarck in a dramatization and interview broadcast over an NBC hookup Tuesday night. Lieutenant Register has been awarded the distinguished flying cross. The broadcast, a feature called \\\"It Happened in the Service\\\" and originating in Hollywood, was carried over Station KFYR here. Bismarck folks who had their radios tuned on when the broadcast started were surprised when the first mention of a Lieutenant Register was made. The announcer, and Register's pilot-friends of the dramatization, referred to the Bismarck youth by the nickname \\\"Cash.\\\" Hen the youthful ace was known as \\\"Pinky.\\\" He is the son of Mr. and Mrs. F. D. Register, 1016 Seventh St. Lt Register recently returned to the United States for a brief furlough. He explained that the navy likes to give its fighting pilots relaxation after gruelling hours of aerial battle and that is why he is back In America. Lt. Register and his wife, the former Ruth Christiansen of Bismarck, daughter of Judge and Mrs, A. M. Christiansen. 1005 Fifth St., will arrive in Bismarck by train Saturday noon. They intend to stop at Seattle on their way here to visit his brother, William Register, and his wife. The Bismarck flier has a 30-day leave, it was learned here. He arrived in San Diego, Calif., last Wednesday and wan joined there by his wife, who has worked in Long Beach while he was fighting overseas. Plans for their welcome in Bismarck already are being made. \\\"North Dakota's first ace ought to get the biggest welcome this city ever gave anybody when he comes back home,\\\" was the consensus of opinion. North Dakota's first ace will not be long away from the smoking battlegrounds of this war. Already he has applied for return to sea duty, and at the end of his present furlough he hopes to be returned to Guadalcanal for another crack at the Japanese, he said. Lt. Register has been a navy flier for little more than a year. He has done duty both aboard aircraft carriers and from land air bases. Exactly how many Nipponese Zeros and bombers Lt. Register has riddled with bullets from his single- seater navy fighter and sent flaming to the, ground or sea U not yet known here, but he has admitted to shooting down at least eight.

Thanksgiving, 1942 (An Editorial) It is just 153 years ago, on another Nov. 26, that the struggling, young United States of America observed its first Thanksgiving. There had been earlier Thanksgiving celebrations, one of the first having been that of the Pilgrim Fathers in the Plymouth colony of Massachusetts, but the one initially proclaimed by President George Washington was the first universally observed in this country by order of the new government. The proclamation is of interest now because it contains the essence of the Thanksgiving idea. In it the Father of his country urged his fellow citizens to pray for guidance for both themselves and their national leaders. He urged them to seek pardon for \\\"national and other transgressions\\\" and to beseech divine providence for the gift of good government. Such was the foundation upon which this national holiday was laid and, even after 153 years, it is difficult to improve it. These still are national needs and it behooves us to remember the fact. To some it may seem that we have little to be thankful for on this holiday. Their families have been torn asunder by war and we know that before another Thanksgiving rolls around some who now serve the nation will have given their lives in defense of liberty. To these Thanksgiving may seem so grim as to be a mockery. They long for the easy days of peace and fancied security. This is only natural. Yet there is a different and broader view. As a nation and as individuals we can be thankful for the freedom which we cherish all the more dearly because it is in danger. We are thankful that our country has not been over-run by a barbarian horde before we could muster our national might to beat off the attackers. To fight for their liberty is a privilege which circumstances have denied to many peoples as deserving and as freedom-loving as we. To date we have suffered few hardships. This is a time to pray that we may have the strength to endure those which certainly lie ahead. It is a season in which we should check up on ourselves and ask pardon for our personal and national transgressions. Ordinarily, Thanksgiving is a day of family reunion, of feasting, of unalloyed joy. It is not such a celebration this year of 1942 and it would be unwise to make it so. Instead it should be what its founders intended it to be; a time of prayerful Thanksgiving for the blessings we do enjoy; of soul-searching that we may recognize our errors and resolve to seek better ways; a period of dedication to the finest traditions of our nation and of resolution to live up to the best that is in us. It is also a time to hope. We have known Thanksgivings which were celebrated under more auspicious circumstances, but never before in the history of any one now living has there been greater need to grasp and hold the fundamental idea back of this holiday. If we do catch this spark of light; if we do here highly resolve to meet the future with fortitude and confidence in the beneficence of an all-wise Providence, we can look forward to the day when a just peace will have restored tranquillity to our war-torn world and when the high spirits and feasting of another day again will be in order.

GREENE Associated Press War Editor Russia's armies squeezed the German \\\"escape corridor\\\" from Stalingrad down to a bare 30 miles Wednesday, engulfed 12 more towns and villages, and boosted enemy losses to nearly 100,000 in a violent seven-day-old offensive which the Nazis admitted had not yet reached its peak. Simultaneously, the G e r m acknowledged that the Russians had succeeded in \\\"temporarily penetrating\\\" Nazi defenses on the Rzhev front, 130 miles northwest of Moscow. A Berlin broadcast said the Russians smashed through after three assaults on the German lines. It was not immediately clear whether this was a full-scale Soviet offensive synchronized with the great counter-drive from Stalingrad, but it was the second time in 24 hours that Berlin had admitted serious breaks in the German lines. Dispatches from Moscow pictured the German siege armies, estimated at 300,000 troops, as hemmed into narrow passageway extending 120 miles westward from Stalingrad, with the Russians attacking furiously from both sides. In addition to nearly 100.000 Nazis killed or captured, unofficial reports said about 120,000 had been wounded.

      "\"Order Half Of Jews In Poland Exterminated BY SIDNEY J. WILLIAMS United Press Staff Correspondent London, Nov. 24.—(LP)—Helnrich Himmler, head of the Nazi Gestapo, has ordered that one-half of the large Jewish population in occupied Poland be exterminated by the end of the year, reports from the Polish underground movement to the Polish government-in-exile here said today. The first step in the bloody program, it was said, would be to kill 50 per cent of the thousands of Jews living in Ghettoes established by the Nazis. The remainder would be \\\"liquidated\\\" later. There were 3,113,900 Jews, or 9.8 per cent of the total population, in Poland, according to the 1931 census, but the Germans during more than three years of occupation have reduced this number by killing thousands outright or permitting them to die of starvation and disease. Special Nazi \\\"liquidation\\\" battalions, commanded by members of the notorious SS Elite Guard, were said to be carrying out Himmler's program. These squads were dragging Jewish victims from their homes or seizing them in streets and driving them to village find town squares in mass roundups for execution, the reports said. Old men and women and cripples were singled out to be herded to cemeteries where they were mowed down by firing squads, Polish sources said. The Nazis made no attempt to prove that the Jews had committed any crimes or violated German regulations. Jews who were not executed immediately, it was reported, were packed into freight cars—150 packed to a car that normally was large j enough for 40—to be shipped to undisclosed points for liquidation. The floors of the cars were covered with a thick layer of chlorate of lime sprinkled with water and the doors were tightly sealed. In some cases the trains reportedly remained on a siding for two days before departing, and many of the Jews died of suffocation. The dead were left in the cars with the living.\n",

Kuss Would Act Now The Soviet government believes the more immediate course of action would serve as a greater deterrence to Nazi brutality than waiting until the end of the war to punish those known to be guilty of atrocities. The American and British governments, however, fear that punishment of axis war criminals during the conflict might lead to miss reprisals against innocent allied war prisoners held by the enemy. One of the difficulties confronting the allied governments is the problem of gathering authentic evidence of the extent to which the Jews are now being persecuted.

Wickard addressed farm leaders of the eleven northeastern states and also held a two-hour press conference during which he discussed various plans to meet war-time food demands. He said he approved subsidies to maintain production and favored increased prices to achieve the same objective in the event subsidies could not be provided. Wickard outlined to the assembled agricultural leaders a plan which w’ould carry the department’s farm production goals individually to the nation’s 6,500,000 farms. He stressed that to meet military, civilian, lend-lease and occupation territory relief in 1943 “we must utilize every acre of land, every machine and every hour.” The food administrator emphasized at his press conference that despite some shortages “America will remain the best fed nation in the world.” he warned however, “that when people get panicky it is La*d to deal with them.” He admitted there might have been “some bungling” of the food problem but added that he has some definite ideas on an educational program to bring the food facts to the public.

      "\"WEDNESDAY EVENING, JULY I, 1942 THE OGDEN STANDARD-EXAMINER 1 !-A GRAIN SURPLUS JOLTS MARKET AS YEAR OPENS New Season Begins on Wednesday With Bins Stuffed By FRANKLIN MULLIN CHICAGO, July \\\\ (AP)--Lowest prices since before Pearl Harbor were paid wheat farmers today for what grain they were willing or forced to sell on the eve of new cycle in the nation's ever-normal granary. With wheat for July delivery quoted near $1.15 on the Chicago board of trade, the price was the lowest since Dec. 1 when $1.13% was paid for December contracts. A year ago wheat was around $1.04 but in January this year it sold as high as $1.37. Tomorrow a new crop year will begin, and, if present prospects materialize, it will be Â· the sixth consecutive season in which the United States will produce more than it can use. This series of big crops, coupled with a World war that has cut off practically all the normal export market, has given the nation a. carryover surplus of old wheat estimated at about 630,000,000 bushels, exceeding any ever accumulated during bumper harvest periods before. With harvesters working their way north, having reached Kansas, the largest wheat producing state, and preparing for full scale operation soon in the fertile Ohio valley, farmers throughout the belt faced a problem of what to do with their new grain. GAS, TIRES ARE 9 MEXICAN BAIT MEXICO CITY, July 1 (AP)-Tourists to Mexico this summer will find not only the usual hospitable welcome but enough tires for emergencies and gas stations which never heard cf rationing. Mexico makes plenty of its own high-octane gasoline and will sell anybody all he wants of it. The prices are pre-war, too--20 centavos, about four cents, a litre, which is about a quart. Tires are another matter. Mexico is dependent on its stored rubber and little bit of guayule, but it has enough stored for a year If the tourist traffic doesn't drain it off. But it also wants to encourage tourist traffic so the government drafted these rules: A tourist can buy a new tire if one he has becomes irreparable while he is in Mexico. Tourists whose tires blow out beyond hope of repair apply to the nearest office of the Mexican Automobile association which issues a certificate permitting them to buy new ones. These new ones can be bought at any tire store, all of which are open. The old tire must be sold to the same dealer at government-fixed scrap rubber prices. S. I. Mayor Urges Cutting of Speed FUNNY BUSINESS \\\"Sergeant, hereafter you will march your men around the apple orchard instead of through it!\\\" Record Breaking Demand Cause of Steel Shortage By S. BURTON HEATH NEW YORK, July 1 (NBA) There have been attempts to find a goat for our bottleneck in steel. The OPA, the industry, President Roosevelt, Gano Dunn, organized labor and the bankers have been blamed. Now that the situation is shaping up, it appears that no individual and no group is responsible. From a standing start, we tried to do too much too fast. We didn't know what we wanted, what we needed, or what we were going to use it for. We tried to win the war without giving up the peace. Outbuilding World Those, really, are the reasons why the greatest steel-producing nation, with a capacity almost equal to all the rest of the civilized world, is having nightmares about steel. We had a steel industry geared to peace. Suddenly we set out to build more vessels in two years than Great Britain, the traditional maritime power, has accumulated in all her history. We undertook to manufacture in two years more planes, more tanks, more guns, more bombs, more shells, more of everything than the rest of the world together. These things were different than we . had been making, and required different plant equipment. Moreover, these things required varying types of fabricating machinery. If we were to produce the proper forms of steel in the necessary quantities, we needed to plan in advance. We couldn't plan efficiently because we did not know what we would require. Our objectives were changed by circumstances at frequent intervals. Our sights were raised constantly, as the acuteness of the united nation's emergency, and our allies' dependence upon our production, became more evident. -Professional Capers For example, consider ships. We have been told that steel plate shortage slowed up production. In May, 1942, the industry turned over to -fa very proper step toward beating Hitler. In fact, the more one inquires in responsible quarters about the steel situation, the less one finds any but professional capers trying to place blame. Â· Instead, the participants are trying to straighten out the mess, and there are indications that they are succeeding. As to the prospects, begin with the fact, apparently sound, that we can make \\\"tiore ingot steel than we actually need, without enlarging our plant any more. The shortage, then, is in shaping apparatus. Plate is a headache. But by the end of this year the continuous strip mills, which used to make automobile steel, will all have been converted to making plate for war purposes. There shouldn't be any bottleneck there. As the war building program is completed, the pressing need for structural forms dies naturally. So far as the prescution of the war is concerned, this is taking care of itself. In no other field is there a major difficulty. There is one other phase, however, which is important. That is the scrap situation. This year our steel plants will fall perhaps six or seven million tons short of its potentialities because of shortage of steel scrap. Speaking of the scrap shortage recently, WPB Chairman Donald Nelson declared: \\\". . . it is none too soon to think of tapping the fences, gates and decorative works.\\\" Half Pig In the American technology, most mills average to use half pig iron and half scrap. It is possible the- orectically, to use all pig. iron. One major producer uses three parts of pig to one of scrap. Another mill about reverses these proportions. To make a .ton'of pig iron, it is necessary to . move four, tons of ore, coal and lime stone. When transportation as 'short as. it is, we CANADIAN MEN TO LEAD WHEN ALLIES ATTACK Security Minister Says Provincial Army Is 'Bulwark' LONDON, July 1 (UP)--Canadian troops will be one of the spearheads of an 'allied invasion of the continent, Home Security Minister Herbert Morrison said in welcoming to Trafalgar Square 40 Canadian firemen, first - to arrive here to aid the British national fire service. \\\"Great number of Canada's army of half a million men are in the British Isles as one of its \\\"main bulwarks,\\\" he said, adding that: \\\"I have no doubt that they will be one of the main spearheads of attack on the enemy.\\\" Air Vice Marshal Harold Edward in another address said that Canadian squadrons in Britain will be expanded by 50'per cent to include bomber group and fighter stations manned entirely by Canadians. ��· The expansion, however, will not affect R. A. F. control of operations, Edward said. can't afford to move four tons when we can get equally good results by moving one ton. To make pig iron requires blast furnaces. We haven't enough to get by without scrap, and we can'1 afford either the metal or the time to build enough furnaces. By sorting and testing, it is possible to make certain importanl aloy steels directly from scrap thus salvaging 'the scarcer alloying meatls of which we can't possibly get enough. Need More Scrap For these and other reasons scrap is vital to steel production Most scrap is a by-product of steel-making and working. Normally a ton of ingot steel produces about 1400 pounds of steel shapes which in turn is cut to about 80C pounds of steel in the finished product. The remaining 1200 pounds becomes scrap, for re-working. But now much steel is going abroad, and the scrap never comes back. Domestic fabricators are so busy they don't return their scrap The expanding program makes increasing demands. The steel mills can't get enough. In cooperation with the WPB, the companies have appropriated a million dollars for a scrap drive. Automobile junk yards, farms, even private, residences are to be combed for'old steel. The companies have no doubl that enough can be found. If they are correct, the mills can run to capacity. In this event, there wil\\\" be all the- ingot we, can. use for really essential purposes, and al the fabricating capacity.; Then there won't be a steel bottleneck any more--for war purposes.

They said that probably 700,000 Jews had been killed in Lithuania and Poland, 125,000 in Rumania, 200,000 in Russia and 100,000 in the rest of Europe.

Recently defeated for renomlnation by John Newsome', a business man and a newcomer to politics, he told the house in a recent 30-mi'nute post mortem speech: \\\"I am not mad at my adversary, so help me. We are friends and get along. Of course, I had rather he had not beaten me, but I am not sore at him.\\\" The 48-year-old Alabaman, who broke the congressional precedent by conducting 15-minute daily radio programs compounded of comments on the views, wisecracks, and homespun verse, warned his colleagues against letting their senses of humor go astray. Blames His Little Joke \\\"Congress had adjourned, and I just passed a li'ttle joke on the radio that afternoon,\\\" Patrick said. \\\"We had a big appropriation bill up here. I said over the radio: \\\"Ladies and gentlemen, we passed some kind of an appropriation bill up there a while ago. I voted for it. You know how ft it with congressmen, we vote a bill out today, and then buy a paper tomorrow to sec what it was.\\\" Patrick said he \\\"thought it was a pretty clever joke\\\" until his opponent started playing a transcription of it throughout his district iso often that he \\\"had nightmares about it.-\\\" Enumerates Reasons A faithful new dealer and an LIBRARIAN DIES BALTIMORE, July 1 (AP) -David E. Roberts, 79, assistant chief of the division of fine arts, library of congress, for 40 years, is dead. early interventionist, Patrick told the house that the following factors had contributed to his defeat: 1. Bad relations between c o n- gress and the press, resulting in \\\"too much distrust and skepticism in the mi'nds of 'the populace toward this congress.\\\" 2. The fa.ct that when he stuck to his work in Washington, his constituents asked if he were getting \\\"high hat,\\\" and when he went home for a visit they said, \\\"You get back on the job.\\\" 3. General dissatisfaction with congress. \\\"They think of you collectively and vote on you individually,\\\" he said. \\\"Each congressman gets blamed for the whole program. In my case I was the only man who was running they could get at.\\\" CHINAMAN KILLED BY CAR BOISE, Idaho, July 1 (AP) -Wong Sing Do, 70, Chinese gardener, was fatally injured yesterday when he stepped into the street in front of a car driven by Charles Bowles of Orchard.

(AP) — Details of a campaign which Dr. Stephen S. Wise said was planned to exterminate all Jews in nazi- occupied Europe by the end of the year are to be laid before a committee of leading Jewish organizations today in New York. The story- which Dr. Wise said was confirmed by the state department and a personal representative of President Roosevelt deals with now more than 2.000,000 Jews already have ben slaughtered in accordance with a race extinction order by Adolf Hitler. Before leaving for New York to address the committee this afternoon, Dr. Wise, chairman of the World Jewish Congress and president of the American Jewish Congress, said he carried official documentary proof that “Hitler has ordered the extermination of all Jews in nazi-ruled Europe in 1942.” After a consultation with state department officials, he announced they had termed authentic certain sources which revealed that approximately half of the estimated 4,000,000 Jews in nazi-occupied Europe already had been killed and that Hitler was wrathful at “failure to complete the extermination immediately.\\\" Moved Into Poland To speed the slaughter of the\n"
